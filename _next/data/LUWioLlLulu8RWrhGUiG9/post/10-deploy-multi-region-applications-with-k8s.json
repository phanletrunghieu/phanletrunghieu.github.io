Run 2 K8S clusters locally for practicing\n\nCreate 2 clusters with 1 master for each cluster. Image clusters put in different regions.\n\nSee [this post](/post/9-run-multi-node-k8s-cluster-locally).\n\n## 2. Solution\n\nIn my case, I use MariaDB with `replication` architecture.\n\n![Solution](/images/10-deploy-multi-region-applications-with-k8s/1-solution.jpg)\n\nI use `bitnami/mariadb` 9.3.4 chart.\n\nI need run mariadb with primary & secondary in different nodes, but `bitnami/mariadb` allow run 1 primary and many secondary nodes. So I need run some customization.\n\n## 3. Customize `bitnami/mariadb` chart\n\nSee my final custom chart on [Github](https://github.com/phanletrunghieu/multi-region-k8s)","categories":["ReactJS","K8s","Docker","GI/CD","Tip","Gitlab","Microservice"],"host":"https://phanletrunghieu.github.io"},"__N_SSG":true}
